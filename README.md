# Pretraining Challenges in Large Language Models

Welcome to the Pretraining Challenges in Language Models open-source project! This repository is dedicated to documenting and addressing various challenges encountered during the pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs). We aim to provide insights  and best practices for researchers and developers working with LLMs.

## Introduction

Language Models like GPT-3, BERT, and their variants have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, working with these models often presents challenges related to loss divergence, numerical instabilities, and other issues during pretraining. This project aims to document these challenges and provide insights into overcoming them.

## Models Covered

We have focused on documenting challenges and solutions for the following pre-trained models:

1. **Meta OPT Model**: [Link to Meta OPT Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068)
2. **Hugging Face Vision Language Model**: [Link to Hugging Face Vision LM](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4)
3. **Bloomberg GT Model**: [Link to Bloomberg GT Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564)

## Challenges and Solutions

In each model-specific folder, you will find detailed markdown files (`.md`) that cover the following aspects:

- **Main Challenge**: A description of the primary challenge faced during pretraining with the model.
- **Solution that Did Not Work**: An explanation of solutions that were attempted but proved unsuccessful.
- **Solution that Worked**: A detailed solution that successfully mitigated the challenge.
- **Bugs/Missteps**: Any bugs or missteps encountered along the way.
- **Learnings**: Key takeaways and lessons learned from the experience.

Browse the model-specific folders to access these valuable insights and solutions.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/meta`: Documentation for the Meta OPT Model
- `/huggingface`: Documentation for the Hugging Face Vision Language Model
- `/bloomberg`: Documentation for the Bloomberg GT Model

Please feel free to contribute by adding your own insights, challenges, or solutions related to these models or by addressing new models not covered in this repository.
